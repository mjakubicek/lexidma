When making a change to a model, you may need to update:
- the actual text in the specification
- the plain-text model description in schemas/informativeCopiesOf3rdPartySchemas/NVH/dmlex_model_description.nvh
  which is also used to generate the UML diagram
- all serializations
- examples of serializations that are next to the specification text
- examples of serializations that are in the examples/ subdirectory
