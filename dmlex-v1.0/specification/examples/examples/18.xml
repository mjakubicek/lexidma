    <title>Modelling subentries (at sense level)</title>
    <para>We have an entry for the word "bible" and another entry for the expression "the Bible". We
        want to make sure that, when a human user is viewing the entry for "bible", the entry for
        "the Bible" is shown as a subentry of it, as if it were its first sense.</para>
