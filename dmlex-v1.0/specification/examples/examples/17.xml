    <title>Modelling subentries (at subsense level)</title>
    <para>We have an entry for the adjective "safe" with two senses, and an entry for the multi-word
        expression "better safe than sorry" with one sense. We want to express the fact that the
        multi-word entry should appear under the first sense of "safe" as a subentry.</para>
